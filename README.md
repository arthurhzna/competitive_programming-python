# Competitive Programming with Python 🐍

I'm on a journey to strengthen my logic and algorithm skills through competitive programming. Every challenge I solve helps me write cleaner code, think more critically, and develop faster, more efficient solutions.

## What Competitive Programming Teaches Me

- **Deeper understanding of algorithms**: Tackling a wide range of problems to master different techniques.
- **Structured thinking**: Building the habit of breaking problems into clear steps.
- **Speed and accuracy under pressure**: Practicing to code effectively within time limits.
